With this code you can upload a list of cities and roads. By giving a start point and an end point you can choose from a variety of algorithms to run and return the full path that you need to follow, the estimated time and some useful info related to the algorithm that run. 

#### Easy Start
1) Just put in the same file Path_Finding_Greece.exe and cities.txt
2) Run the Path_Finding_Greece.exe
3) Choose the option 8 to upload cities.txt by typing "cities.txt"
4) You can do everything you want from below context


#### Menu

As you can clearly see there are many options in order to add, edit, load, and save cities and roads through 1-8 options. 

#### City

A city is basically a point with certain name, latitude, and longtitude.

#### Road

A road consists of 2 cities and the distance in km.

#### Algorithms

The list of algorithms that are available is:

In order to see their results on real test, we would like to go from the starting point Korinthos to the end point Thessaloniki. So the following results are for this certain route.

* DFS
